Donated clothes are collected at their store locations and are either sold at affordable prices or distributed to those in need. The proceeds from sales directly fund AHF’s mission to provide cutting-edge medicine and advocacy, regardless of a person’s ability to pay.\n\nOut of the Closet thrift stores serve multiple purposes: they offer an accessible way for people to contribute to a charitable cause, they promote sustainability by giving secondhand clothes a new life, and they provide resources for those affected by HIV/AIDS. Additionally, many store locations offer free HIV testing, making these stores a vital hub for both community engagement and public health. Out of the Closet blends charity, healthcare, and sustainability.\n\n\n\n\n\n",
