The proceeds from sales directly fund AHF’s mission to provide cutting-edge medicine and advocacy, regardless of a person’s ability to pay.\n\nOut of the Closet thrift stores serve multiple purposes: they offer an accessible way for people to contribute to a charitable cause, they promote sustainability by giving secondhand clothes a new life, and they provide resources for those affected by HIV/AIDS. Additionally, many store locations offer free HIV testing, making these stores a vital hub for both community engagement and public health. Out of the Closet blends charity, healthcare, and sustainability.\n\n\n\n\n\n",
